#Life Seasoning

A personal list of films to watch, songs to listen to, foods to try, etc.

I like experiencing new and different things. I like understanding what forms people's view of the world they inhabit.

And instead of always forgetting what tips people give me, such as; "Oh man, you need to watch the Inbetweeners" I figured, might as well make it into lists with versioning.
